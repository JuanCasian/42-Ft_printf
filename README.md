# Ft_printf
Ft_printf is the first project in the Algorithms and Artiifcial Inteligence branck at 42 School Silicon Valley. In this project I was asked to create a function which replicates the Stdio library "Printf" function. In this function we needed to take care of almost all the specifiers (excluding the floating type), all the flags, the lengths, the diferent widths and precisions.
